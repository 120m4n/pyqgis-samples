# PyQGIS samples

The QGIS API based on C++ comments can scare new Python QGIS users when they need to go further.

This repository is an attempt to start to cover all the Python QGIS API. It'a work in progress.

At the moment, we are documenting mainly the gui and core modules from QGIS.

You can see progress at:

* [core](core.md)
* [gui](gui.md)



The long term goals are:

* providing samples in the [official cookbook PyQGIS developer](http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/) documentation
* check current samples outside the documentation itself to test and better maintain current samples
